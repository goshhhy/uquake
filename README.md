μQuake
======

μQuake is my own personal fork of the Quake engine.

i am prioritizing making the code build cleanly under modern compilers (gcc 7.4+, clang 8+),
retaining ease of portability, and reducing memory usage as much as possible. a future goal
is to be able to run the engine on the original playstation, which has only 2mb of ram.
